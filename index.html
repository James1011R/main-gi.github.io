<p>I'm main_gi/Igniam, a critic, game designer and puzzle designer. I also write video-game-inspired original music, having lots of distinct melodies with few repeats, and have created terminology for music concepts that focus on melody and modern electronic inventions. For example, a <strong>trime</strong> is defined as a 3-note melody. It comes from <strong>tri-</strong> and the start of <strong>me</strong>lody. Music terms have failed to catch up - there was no existing word for it until now - so I made my own.</p>

<p>My personality and writing style reflects challenging and improving the norms, and no filler content. I didn't write this in third-person or use super long words.</p>

<p>For fun, I mostly play puzzle games and used to play first-person shooters. Anything with any strategy will appeal to me, like CCGs and mysteries.</p>

<p>I have a lot of articles written behind the scenes, but my goal is that most of them will be visual and interactive. It'd be much easier to explain music when you can play and edit my examples. Basically, <b>this site is incomplete and there'll be a huge burst of articles later</b>.</p>

<p>Have some exported music I had laying around.</p>

<p class="smalltext"><b>Misty Mesa</b>: A calm fusion of desert and snow. Yes, it contradicts "few repeats", but I really liked the main melody.</p>

<p class="smalltext"><b>Misty Miracle</b>: I decided to instrumentswap <b>Misty Mesa</b> and add drums. I liked the result. You'll probably find the start and end uninspired, but I am proud of the middle section and the activity of the middle melody.</p>

<p style="line-height: 1"><span style="font-size: 75%">Other stuff I do, but isn't what I'd like to be known as main skills, in order: testing games and software, finding unintended solutions to puzzles, fiction writing (very infrequent, but I like comedic writing), proofreading, UI design, infrequent programming (even though I dislike it), occasional trolling, transcribing (both in music and text)</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 1"><span style="font-size: 75%">Things I'm bad at or dislike somehow: bad at art and drawing (I don't dislike art), dealing with computer servers, horror games (I dislike jumpscares mostly), the color orange, "The DNS server isn't responding"</span></p>
