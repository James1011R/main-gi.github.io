<div class="all"><div id="content" class="content" style="width: 100%; max-width: 100%"><div class="rester info-dense"><!-- The notation for lanes is A for ally lanes and E for enemy lanes, so A6 = ally lane 6, E7 = enemy lane 7. I use numbers 1-7 instead of 0-6.

Puzzle 1 took me about 10-15 minutes to solve. I thought there'd be a lot of red herrings, and was initially surprised that I would need to have high health minions for the large unit to attack into (I thought I could suicide my minions into the 11 damage unit and it would take 33 damage). But it was pretty good.

Puzzle 1
(8 8b) False Mjölnir the Draugr on E6
(6 7b) Einherjar Berserkr on A6 activates (1bb)
(5 5b) Seahaven on A6
(4 3b) Einherjar Berserkr on A6 attacks enemy player twice [23-3-3=17]
(4 3b) Jotun Shatterfist on A5 attacks Drauger on E6 [17-9=8]
(4 3b) Fossegrim on A1
(1 1b) Einherjar Berserkr on A6 swaps with Bragi Runesinger on A7
(1 1b) Burn Jaunt
(2 2b) Berserkr Sickness on Bragi Runesinger on A6
(1 1b) Bragi Runesinger on A6 attacks enemy player and then attacks Drauger on E6 [8-3-5=0]

Puzzle 2 took me a while to solve, probably about an hour. I spent about 40 minutes not realizing Rainbow's End's passive was used here, and got distracted by all the red herrings - I was pretty fooled by every one of them.

Puzzle 2
(9 6b3p) Jorthsong on E2 (you could use A7, but removing the Mirage prevents you from accidentally attacking into it later)
(7 4b3p) Balance
(3 4b1p) Decoy on A4 attacks Eager Recruit on E3
(3 4b1p) Cairnhenge on A4
(10 3b1p) Field of Poppies on A6
(14 2b1p) Daijogu Supreme on A1 activates (4) [28-4=24]
(10 2b1p) Impel the Daijogu Supreme on A1
(8 2b1p) Daijogu Supreme moves to A2
(8 2b1p) Daijogu Supreme on A2 activates (4) [24-4=20]
(4 2b1p) Demolition Speedway on A2
(5 0b1p) Pocket Instance on A3
(9 0b0p) Burn Jaunt
(10 1b0p) Cairnhenge on A5
(13 0b0p) Daijogu Supreme on A2 attacks enemy player and activates three times (12) [20-8-4-4-4=0]

Puzzle 3 - at first, I thought it was straightforward - I read an article before discussing Red Cliffs and noted the anti-Rush affected the whole board. And the Necromatic gets back a crappy Kobolok. Then opponent got 1 health from Life Tap. Oops. And then after a few more minutes, I solved it (just under 8 minutes total), but sort of feel like I cheesed it (opponent had -1 health at the end).

Puzzle 3
(9 6r3p) Dashing Ringmaster on A1 attacks Strigoi Pup on E1 [6+1=7]
(9 6r3p) Impel the Master of Shadows on A4
(7 6r3p) Move Master of Shadows to A3
(7 6r3p) Master of Shadows to A3 attacks Hopeless Necromatic on E2
(7 6r3p) Ignition on Grinning Kobolok on E2
(6 5r3p) Racer in Shadow on A1
(5 5r2p) Racer in Shadow on A1 attacks enemy player [7-2=5]
(5 5r2p) Wings of Abaddon on A2
(1 4r2p) Wings of Abaddon on A2 activates and kills Racer in Shadow on A1
(1 4r2p) Wings of Abaddon on A2 attacks enemy player [5-4=1]
(1 4r2p) Burn Panic Raider
(2 5r2p) Daring Trapezists on A1
(0 5r2p) Daring Trapezists on A1 attacks enemy player [1-2=-1]

Puzzle 4 - Okay, this is ridiculous. On first glance opponent has a ton of artifacts and we're going for a Volition OTK I guess? Or - we have a way to cycle that thing on A4, potentially dealing 5 or 6 damage over and over. Oh and we're totally shifting our opponent's nonsense left. And then we've got the black/white Cadejo thing, which I've never played in a game, so maybe we should be sacrificing our own units into laser grids.

10 minutes in: Oh. I just realized I can cycle my Volition. I got my opponent down to 3 health, and I massively messed up my gem economy (2 green gems left and no yellows). I am completely not used to the gem system. And how did I get a Clay Effigy into my deck somehow? Oh wait - I burned it! Okay, cool!

15 minutes in: Hm... I found something that gets my opponent down to 2 health, and I know if I managed my mana better (with the bonus mana enchantment) I could have had enough for Infuse for 1 health. But... Oh, and then there's the disk that I could use to discard something. And maybe if that rightmost Cadejo survives I can Volition it again?

21 minutes in: I realized I can cycle Bela, Witch Queen.

22 minutes in: Nope. Stunning the 11/11 doesn't work to clear Defender.

27 minutes in: I tried using the Marching Orders to the right instead. Thought of using Infuse to kill the 2/3 that draws a card so I could have an extra damage. It didn't really work. And I had to discard a card I didn't really want to discard.

31 minutes in: I realized you can put Clay Effigy on the opponent's side, which if you do it on both, triggers opponent's Model of Duality. May be an extra damage, but I hope I don't run out of space or block my own attacks.

35 minutes in: Okay, this Thunderbird is really crappy. I think I may not use it. And I thought of Marching Orders being the card you get back so you can get an attack with the Black Cadejo.

43 minutes: That didn't work. Opponent at 2 life and never using the Thunderbird. I swear, if that Detained is used somehow... don't tell me that's used to give something Immobile and it won't be movable by Marching Orders... I just tested it, it doesn't work that way.

46 minutes: Don't see what else to do, so I'm gonna do it. Dump the 11/11 out and give him +1 card in hand. And I might as well do the Bela cycle if I'm playing all these 2 cost spells. (Somehow the first Detained costed 0 instead of 1. Actually, this seems like a bug, the mana was 1 in the graveyard and went to 0 in hand.)

1 hour 1 minute: Went back to an older solution. 2 mana, 2 green gems, opponent at 1... surely this is close.

1 hour 10 minutes: What if we brought back Mothmara with Deported?

1 hour 14 minutes: This doesn't work at all. It costs me the attack from White Cadejo.

1 hour 22 minutes: You know, I've been noticing something that I saw very early on. You can use A4 and the laser grids at the start to kill the 2/5 and deal +1 damage. That would usually be too small to matter, but in this case my to-1-life solution has never got any use out of the unit from Wake the Bones. So maybe... just maybe...

1 hour 24 minutes: Holy crap. It worked. That was so very cool.

Minmaxer's Coup

I think, because you can draw with the Disk, that the Fey Plagiarist should be burned.

...Weird... The HP of my opponent's health is odd, implying I want Fey Plagiarist to hit. But I actually can manage to take out both of my two opponent's center units, so maybe I should just focus on clearing one side. My Enyo got to a 20/20 at highest.

Oh, I see. Kite Glider must be a distraction. I can copy enchants too. So maybe I move Enyo into The Fast Lane, copy Stairway to Hades? That would be a great multiplier effect for sure. And instead of playing Magmataur I'd purposely discard it. Wait, but then the Enyo respawned wouldn't get Rush...?

<h2 id="puzzle-5">Puzzle 5</h2>

<p>6m: Got opponent down to 38 health. Also, I thought burning was useless at first, but we're missing a gem, so we can definitely burn here. Also, this entire puzzle has only one desert location, it seems.</p>

<p>15m: This isn't working. I can't kill the enemy units, it's too inefficient. It's like I should ignore Perfect Grade or something.</p>

<p>23m: WHAT? The desert action standardification thing works on the things not named Desert? Utter nonsense...</p>

<p>27m: Okay, I have a "down to 2 HP" solution - suiciding Storied Martyr, ignitioning the deadly unit to kill it, and using Infuse. I burned Dire Benediction to play one of the tokens (the last card in my hand is an Insurgent). This is really close. At this point I think I may have just made an ordering mistake or something.</p>

<p>28m: WAIT A MINUTE I STILL WIN. I just smashed the Ringmaster into the 6/7, which killed it (I thought it had Alpha Strike?) and the leftover crappy unit had 2 attack, which technically means it's overkill for 1.</p>

<p>By the way, are you a second language speaker? You're using the ’ apostrophe in the puzzles, which is causing it to show up as if there's no apostrophe at all in the intros.</p>

<p>One thing I didn't know is that apparently my standard action only counts as 1 more attack instead of 2 from Frenzy.</p>

<h2 id="puzzle-6">Puzzle 6</h2>

<p>1m: Okay, so I think the trick here is Overrun beats Immortal, so you want to attack through the Immortal targets. I mostly come from Eternal and only know this interaction because of Life Tap "inconsistencies".</p>

<p>3m: Also I can kill immortal stuff with Focused Frenzy.</p>

<p>5m: First attempt brings enemy down to 22 health, really not good enough. Volkov Pointman probably has to go to A2, but then...?</p>

<p>7m: Oh crap! Breath of Wintertide is like a Slayer 3 in this context. I thought it was crap!</p>

<p>8m: 3 mana left, one Impel usage, and a Canine Cavalry that sees no use, and opponent has 7 health left. Wait, I have DISK?! And I can impel Cavalry over. So that's what, 5 extra disk dama- that's exact, huh?</p>

<p>9m: Yup, that was it!</p>

<h3 id="puzzle-6-solution">Puzzle 6 Solution</h3>

<p>(8 4b5g) Pillage targeting enemy War Fan<br />
(5 4b3g) Burn Avenging Alpha<br />

(3 3b0g) Breath of Wintertide on E3<br />
(3 2b0g) Impel Volkov Veteran on A2<br />
(1 2b0g) Attack with Volkov Veteran twice [54-8-10=36], move the Volkov Veteran to A3 and attack with Winter Wolf twice [36-15-15=6] and finally attack with Volkov Heavy [6-6=0]. I'm pretty sure you could have used Berserkr Sickness on Volkov Heavy as well to deal the same damage, which is really nice.</p>

<h2 id="puzzle-7">Puzzle 7</h2>

<p>1m: What is this nonsense? Temptation Brass Bouncer? Does that even work? We also got Freki Sidecar in the dump... Also, Cairnhenge with Rainbow's End for extra mana is a thing.</p>

<p>4m: Okay, if I Marching Orders left, the enchantment is put to the far left, which makes sense to me.</p>

<p>6m: Temptation on the Frenzy seems like the most damage dealing thing I could do, despite it being covered a lot...</p>

<p>10m: I'm on some other path involving Skyranger on the left. I've already dealt enough damage for opponent to be on 6 health, but my "move away the thing and temptation" doesn't work, cause Immobile. Argh...</p>

<p>14m: I think I got it.</p>

<p>15m: Yup, that was it. Though I think I broke your puzzle again, as I have 1 overkill damage.</p>

(1 3b0g0o) Cairnhenge on A6, just because, and attack with both [11-7-5=-1]</p>

<h2 id="puzzle-8">Puzzle 8</h2>

<p>3m: First attempt, I got the enemy down to 11. And I'm using Flame Scrolls. There's also the Stubborn Tengu loop with Sidecar?</p>

<p>6m: Yeah, that is uh, not happening, until the Revolutionary Totem is gone. I guess I need to go kill stuff with Master of Shadows.</p>

<p>8m: Sidecar on the Giant Stairway and kill the 2/2? Oh, screw you Totem. And Lurker, so I can't even attack it? Screw that.</p>

<p>10m: Better idea. I checked the deck early and know a Jaunt is sitting there. So I'll just teleport that.</p>

<p>11m: Defender? Sigh...</p>

<p>14m: Okay, opponent's down to 5. Not good enough. I noted it seemed I was really low on mana, and it's probably because I didn't use a Poppy replace.</p>

<p>18m: Huh? I have 9 overkill damage.</p>

<p>Yes. Nine.</p>

<p>Cool!</p>
